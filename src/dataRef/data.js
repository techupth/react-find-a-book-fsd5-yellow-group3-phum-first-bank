          "Learn how to write cross platform React Native code by using effective design patterns in the JavaScript world. Get to know industry standard patterns as well as situational patterns. Decouple your application with these set of “Idea patterns”. Key FeaturesMobile development in React Native should be done in a reusable way. Learn how to build scalable applications using JavaScript patterns that are battle tested.Try effective techniques on your own using over 80 standalone examples.Book Description React Native helps developers reuse code across different mobile platforms like iOS and Android. This book will show you effective design patterns in the React Native world and will make you ready for professional development in big teams. The book will focus only on the patterns that are relevant to JavaScript, ECMAScript, React and React Native. However, you can successfully transfer a lot of the skills and techniques to other languages. I call them “Idea patterns”. This book will start with the most standard development patterns in React like component building patterns, styling patterns in React Native and then extend these patterns to your mobile application using real world practical examples. Each chapter comes with full, separate source code of applications that you can build and run on your phone. The book is also diving into architectural patterns. Especially how to adapt MVC to React environment. You will learn Flux architecture and how Redux is implementing it. Each approach will be presented with its pros and cons. You will learn how to work with external data sources using libraries like Redux thunk and Redux Saga. The end goal is the ability to recognize the best solution for a given problem for your next mobile application. What you will learnExplore the design Patterns in React NativeLearn the best practices for React Native developmentExplore common React patterns that are highly used within React Native developmentLearn to decouple components and use dependency injection in your applicationsExplore the best ways of fetching data from the backend systemsLearn the styling patterns and how to implement custom mobile designsExplore the best ways to organize your application code in big codebasesWho this book is for The ideal target audience for this book are people eager to learn React Native design patterns who already know the basics of JavaScript. We can assume that the target audience already knows how to write Hello World in JavaScript and know what are the functions, recursive functions, JavaScript types and loops.",

By the end of this book you will be able to build and deploy React applications using the Next.js framework to fully render server-side HTML on every Web page. You'll begin by reviewing JavaScript fundamentals and how they work with the core principles of React. You'll then move on to Next.js, the React framework for server-rendered applications. Using this framework, you will create a fast and secure solutional React application that renders content on the server-side, protects sensitive information, and optimizes response times. Before deploying the application using Docker containers, you'll create automated unit tests to verify that every component is appropriately doing its job Building React Apps with Server-Side Rendering also covers other fun and interesting topics such as Bootstrap 4, JSX (JavaScript XML), adding styling to your React applications, and much more. By the end of this book, you will be able to build and deploy React applications that fully render server-side HTML on every page. In the end you'll have a client-side rendered React application that integrates server-side rendering into it using Next.js framework.

What you will learn. In "The Road to React" you will learn about all the fundamentals of React.js with Hooks while building a full-blown React application step by step. While you create the React application, every chapter will introduce you to a new React key feature. However, there is more than only the fundamentals: The book dives into related topics (e.g. React with TypeScript, Testing, Performance Optimizations) and advanced feature implementations like client- and server-side searching. At the end of the book, you will have a fully working deployed React application. Is it up to date? Programming books are usually outdated soon after their release, but since this book is self- published, I can update it as needed whenever a new version of something related to this book gets released. I am a beginner. Is this book for me? Yes. The book starts from zero and takes you through the learning experience step by step. Every chapter builds up on the learnings from the previous chapter. In addition, at the end of every chapter, exercises fortify your lessons learned. If you got stuck in a chapter, you will always find a reference URL to the status quo of the actual code. Core Concepts Pragmatic: Master React while building a complete application step by step. Problems Solving: You need to experience a problem first before solving it. The Why: Readers like how the book answers the Why, not only the How.

        description:
          "In conflict-affected regions, delays in international response can have life or death consequences. The speed with which international organizations react to crises affects the prospects for communities to re-establish peace. Why then do some international organizations take longer than others to answer calls for intervention? To answer this question and explore options for reform, Time to React builds on contemporary scholarship with original data on response rates and interview evidence from 50 ambassadors across four leading organizations (AU, EU, OAS and OSCE). The explanation for variation in speed ultimately lies in core differences in institutional cultures across organizations. Although wealth and capabilities can strengthen a peace operation, it is the unspoken rules and social networks of peace and security committees at these organizations that dictate the pace with which an operation is established. This book offers a first analysis of the critical importance of and conditions shaping timeliness of crisis response by international organizations.",

          "The book dives deeply into state management in React. You will learn everything about React's local state and state management with Redux and MobX. It comes with a lot of best practices, techniques and concepts. Along the way you will have practical hands on experiences by building own applications. The book turned out to exceed all my expectations. What started as an attempt to write a introductory book about state management in React with Redux, turned out into a full blown 250-page book which showcases MobX as alternative state management library, implements exciting applications along the way and has boilerplate projects to get you started in learning and building applications with these libraries. The bigger idea was to write a book which gives learners a consistent way to study the topic state management. I had the feeling that there exist way too many, partly inconsistent or outdated, tutorials around these topics and it is hard for learners to choose from so many opportunities. I thought, one well structured book should help newcomers to get started easily in the topic of state management with React's local state, Redux and MobX. Afterward, everyone should be on one well set level to build his/her own applications with Redux or MobX. The book teaches you how to use local state in React and scaling React applications with advanced practices, patterns and techniques. Afterward, the ebook dives into learning Redux and MobX as libraries for state management. These libraries are taught from scratch without React but in combination with React later on. However, all these learnings are not necessarily bound to React as view layer library. They can be applied in other view layer (component based) libraries, such as Vue.js, or single page application (SPA) frameworks, such as Angular.js, too. If you are new to React and want to learn React before, I recommend you to read the up to date book The Road to learn React. Due to Redux's popularity, the book teaches more about Redux than MobX. But it is planned to grow the MobX part too, because I am really into that library as well. For both state management libraries, Redux and MobX, you will learn to use them standalone, to connect them to React applications in multiple ways, and to apply best practices, patterns and tricks to scale them in larger applications. You will learn about using JavaScript ES6 to keep your state immutable, middleware in Redux, and flat and normalized state structures. Afterward, the terms actions, reducers, store(s), connected components and so on, will not be foreign subjects to you anymore. After reading the book, I believe you are ready to build your own applications in any (view layer) library or SPA framework of your choice with Redux or MobX. But when using React, you are setup with advanced knowledge about React's local state to use it in larger applications.",

          "Discover the current landscape of full-stack development and how to leverage modern web technologies for building production-ready React.js applications to deploy on AWS Key FeaturesUnderstand the architecture of React and single-page applicationsBuild a modern Web API for your SPA using Node.js, Express, and GraphQLGain a clear and practical understanding of how to build a complete full-stack applicationBook Description React sets the standard for building high-performance client-side web apps. Node.js is a scalable application server that is used in thousands of websites, while GraphQL is becoming the standard way for large websites to provide data and services to their users. Together, these technologies, when reinforced with the capabilities of TypeScript, provide a cutting-edge stack for complete web application development. This book takes a hands-on approach to implementing modern web technologies and the associated methodologies for building full-stack apps. You’ll begin by gaining a strong understanding of TypeScript and how to use it to build high-quality web apps. The chapters that follow delve into client-side development with React using the new Hooks API and Redux. Next, you’ll get to grips with server-side development with Express, including authentication with Redis-based sessions and accessing databases with TypeORM. The book will then show you how to use Apollo GraphQL to build web services for your full-stack app. Later, you’ll learn how to build GraphQL schemas and integrate them with React using Hooks. Finally, you’ll focus on how to deploy your application onto an NGINX server using the AWS cloud. By the end of this book, you’ll be able to build and deploy complete high-performance web applications using React, Node, and GraphQL. What you will learnDiscover TypeScript’s most important features and how they can be used to improve code quality and maintainabilityUnderstand what React Hooks are and how to build React apps using themImplement state management for your React app using ReduxSet up an Express project with TypeScript and GraphQL from scratchBuild a fully functional online forum app using React and GraphQLAdd authentication to your web app using RedisSave and retrieve data from a Postgres database using TypeORMConfigure NGINX on the AWS cloud to deploy and serve your appsWho this book is for The book is for web developers who want to go beyond front-end web development and enter the world of full-stack web development by learning about modern web technologies and how they come together.
